#In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:
#Example:-
x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x, y, z)

#You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:
#Example:-
x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "awesome"
print(x + y + z)

#For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:
#Example
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)

#In the print() function, when you try to combine a string and a number with the + operator, Python will give you an error:
#Example
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x + y) #here the error will be shown
