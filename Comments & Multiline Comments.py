# (Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them)
#Example:-
#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")

#Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:
#Example:-
print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment

# you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
#Example
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
