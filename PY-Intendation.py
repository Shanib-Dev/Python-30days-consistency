   #Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:
   #after the condition line the space we give for any condition output is called Intendation.
   #The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.
   #EXAMPLE:-
if 5 > 3:
   print("YES")
