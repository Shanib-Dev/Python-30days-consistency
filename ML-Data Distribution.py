"Data Distribution"
#Earlier in this tutorial we have worked with very small amounts of data in our examples, just to understand the different concepts.
#In the real world, the data sets are much bigger, but it can be difficult to gather real world data, at least at an early stage of a project.
#How Can we Get Big Data Sets?
#To create big data sets for testing, we use the Python module NumPy, which comes with a number of methods to create random data sets, of any size.
#Example
#Create an array containing 250 random floats between 0 and 5:
import numpy

x = numpy.random.uniform(1, 200, 200)
print(x)

"Histogram"
#To visualize the data set we can draw a histogram with the data we collected.
#We will use the Python module Matplotlib to draw a histogram.
#Learn about the Matplotlib module in our Matplotlib Tutorial.
#Example
#Draw a histogram:
import numpy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
x= numpy.random.uniform(0.0, 5.0, 200)
plt.hist(x, 10)
plt.show()

"Histogram Explained"
#We use the array from the example above to draw a histogram with 5 bars.
#The first bar represents how many values in the array are between 0 and 1.
#The second bar represents how many values are between 1 and 2.
#Etc.
#Which gives us this result:
"""
52 values are between 0 and 1
48 values are between 1 and 2
49 values are between 2 and 3
51 values are between 3 and 4
50 values are between 4 and 5
"""

"Big Data Distributions"
#An array containing 250 values is not considered very big, but now you know how to create a random set of values, and by changing the parameters, you can create the data set as big as you want.
#Example
#Create an array with 100000 random numbers, and display them using a histogram with 100 bars:
y = numpy.random.uniform(0.0, 5.0, 100000)
plt.hist(y, 5)
plt.show()
